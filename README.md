# course-data

For Carleton!

A sister repository to <https://github.com/StoDevX/course-data/>, which holds St. Olaf course data.

## Usage
If you are interested in using the course data in another tool, it's hosted through Github on the `gh-pages` branch.

You can download it however you'd like, such as via curl. Assuming you want the 2016-Fall data in `json` format (aka the file `20161.json`), you'd do:

	curl https://stodevx.github.io/course-data/terms/20161.json

We have data from 1999-Fall through this year, whatever this year is, automatically updated from ENROLL once a day.

Each course in `courses/` looks like this:

```json

	"comments": [],
	"credits": 6.0,
	"department": "AFST",
	"id": "AFST 112.00",
