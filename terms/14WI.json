It can be argued that animals face a relatively small set of basic challenges: they must acquire food, water, and mates, and they must avoid danger. Yet we see a rich diversity of solutions to these problems. Consider foraging behavior, for example. All animals must acquire energy, but some filter particles out of sea water, others graze on nearly inedible grasses, while still others hunt in cooperative packs. In this course we will consider such topics as foraging, communication, sociality, and conflict. By focusing on the functions and evolutionary histories of behaviors, we strive to better understand the puzzle of behavioral diversity.",

In this class, students will experiment with a variety of front-of-camera animation techniques to build sensitivity and gain proficiency in this unique manipulation of materials and time. We will explore clay, object, and hinged-paper puppet traditions as well as other sculptural methods. Exercises will emphasize movement strategies and cinematic concerns such as mise-en-scene and figure-ground relationships as they relate specifically to stop motion. Students will each pitch and complete a final animation project exploring these concepts in depth.",
