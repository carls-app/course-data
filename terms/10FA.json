As we enter the twentyÂ­first century, the pervasiveness of law continues to grow. We begin this course by exploring the ubiquity of law and the implications of this for our dayÂ­toÂ­day lives. Next we examine definitions of law, the development of law, and the extent to which law is shaped by the wider social and cultural contexts in which it is embedded. We conclude by examining specific issues such as legal consciousness, the legal profession, and law and social inequality. Readings include classic and contemporary theoretical works on law and society, and current empirical applications.",

Issues of gender, power, and social location also receive attention.
