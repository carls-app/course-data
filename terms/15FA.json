In this seminar we will read literary works by Arab authors written over approximately 1000 years--from the Crusades, the height of European imperialism, and on into the age of Iraq, Obama and ISIS. Through our readings and discussions, we will ask along with Arab authors: Is conflict between Arabs and Westerners the inevitable and unbridgeable result of differing world-views, religions and cultures? Are differences just a result of poor communication? Or is this \"cultural conflict\" something that can be understood historically?",

Did you ever get the feeling that \"there has to be a better/smarter way to do this problem?\" The Data Structures course is all about how to store information intelligently and access it efficiently. How can Google take your query, compare it to billions of web pages, and return the answer in less than one second? How can one store information so as to balance the competing needs for fast data retrieval and fast data modification? To help us answer questions like these, we will analyze and implement stacks, queues, trees, linked lists, graphs and hash tables.

While the course focuses on the scientific aspects of agroecosystem sustainability, comparisons will be made among various production models both in the U.S. and China, bringing in social, economic and policy issues. This course is part of the OCS winter break China program, involving two linked courses in fall and winter terms, this class is the first class in the sequence.",

Admiration of technological progress and political stability was combined with a pervasive anti-Americanism, which was, according to political scientist Andrei Markovits, the \"lingua franca\" of modern Europe. These often contradictory perceptions of the United States were crucial in the process of forming national histories and mythologies as well as a common European identity. Accordingly, this course will explore the many and often contradictory views expressed by Europe's emerging mass publics and intellectual and political elites about the United States during this period.",

This course will consider the nature of these eco-cultural developments, focusing on the complicated ways that human thought and perception, culture and society, and natural processes and biota have all combined to forge Americans' changing relationship with the natural world. Topics will include Native American subsistence strategies, Euroamerican settlement, industrialization, urbanization, consumption, and the environmental movement. As we explore these issues, one of our overarching goals will be to develop an historical context for thinking deeply about contemporary environmental dilemmas.",

Territorial expansion over three-and-a-half centuries had brought under Russian rule a vast empire of immense diversity. The empire's subjects spoke a myriad languages, belonged to numerous religious communities, and related to the state in a wide variety of ways. Its artists produced some of the greatest literature and music of the nineteenth century and it offered fertile ground for ideologies of both conservative imperialism and radical revolution. This course surveys the panorama of this empire from its inception in the sixteenth century to its demise in the flames of World War I. Among the key analytical questions addressed are the following: How did the Russian Empire manage its diversity? How does Russia compare with other colonial empires? What understandings of political order legitimized it and how were they challenged?",

Then we will deal with responsibility and punishment, and challenges to the idea of the primacy of individual rights from legal paternalism and moralism. We will next inquire into the explanations of why individuals should obey the law, and conditions under which civil disobedience is justified. Finally, we will discuss issues raised by feminist legal theory and some theories of minority rights.",

In this course, we aim to cover the major developments in the philosophy of science since that time, including: the rise of logical empiricism; Karl Popper's famous insistence that scientific claims must be subjected to possible falsification; Thomas Kuhn's concept of scientific revolutions as paradigm shifts; recent attempts to understand scientific activities, including knowledge acquisition, as distinctively social processes. Some of the main questions we will consider are: How do evidence and confirmation operate in the empirical sciences? Should we believe in the existence of theoretical entities such as quarks and genes? What is it to provide an explanation of some phenomenon, as opposed to merely predicting or describing it?",

		"summary": "The distinction between chaos and order--particularly hierarchical order--is crucial to the Greek philosophical tradition. For one thing, it guides discussions of the natural world. Ancient philosophers disagreed about whether to explain natural phenomena in terms of atoms interacting randomly with each other, in terms of a harmonious set of goal-oriented natural laws, or in some other way. For another thing, the distinction between chaos and order shapes discussions of ethics and human psychology. How should we understand inner conflict, for example? Can reason establish order in our souls by ruling over the emotions? Finally, it is central to political philosophy. Several thinkers, in particular, tried to understand the seeming chaos and conflict associated with democracy by comparing it with the mythical ideal of benevolent, all-powerful kings. In this course, designed as an introduction to ancient philosophy, we will see how this theme appears in texts from the Presocratics to Epicurus. Before the term is over we will consider arguments about the origins of the universe, the permissibility of civil disobedience, and the role of philosophy in the political community. Throughout, we will consider both the similarities and differences between ancient and modern approaches to these topics.",

We fall prey to wishful thinking, gullibility, dogmatism, confirmation bias, rationalization, probabilistic fallacies, and formal fallacies (just to name a few of our problematic tendencies). From the epistemic point of view--that is, from the point of view of trying to get to the truth and avoid falsity---this looks lamentable. We might even be led to a general distrust of our ability to properly reason. On the other hand, it might be that \"some\" of these tendencies are tied to cognitive structures and mechanisms that are in fact good and desirable from the epistemic point of view. Or maybe it's just confused to think there is any such thing as \"the epistemic point of view.\" In this seminar, we will consider these issues from the standpoints of epistemology, meta-epistemology, and cognitive science. Authors to be read include Kahneman and Tversky, Stephen Stich, Richard Nisbett, Edward Stein, and Ruth Millikan.",

Yet, given that law and religion often stake out the same territory--from how we raise our children to how we run our businesses--such an agenda is never as easy as it might seem. In many parts of the Islamic world, on the other hand, activist movements are seeking to transform shari'a (God's will) into state law.  Here too, ideals are troubled by realities, as complex religious systems are shoehorned into rigid legal frameworks.  This course will explore the intersections of religion and law in these two distinct contexts, looking at how religion and law come to shape one another and why their intersection is often at the center of key contemporary conflicts, both domestic and international.",

Interrogating this tradition, along with differing conceptions of social criticism, we raise numerous questions, such as: Is the Jeremiad tradition still a viable mode of prophetic exhortation? And, with much of contemporary (Black) Christianity's allegiance to capitalism, can the Jeremiad continue to play a prophetic socio-critical role today? This course counts as an African/African American interdisciplinary course.",

The course will look specifically at how these identities interact with other phenomena such as government, family, and popular culture. In exploring sexual diversity, we will highlight the complexity and variability of sexualities, both across different historical periods, and in relation to identities of race, class, and ethnicity.",

Some questions that will occupy us are: How do we know what we know? Who does research? Does it matter who the researcher is? How does the social location (race, class, gender, sexuality) of the researcher affect research? Who is the research for? How can research relate to efforts for social change? While answering these questions, we will consider how different feminist researchers have dealt with them.",

We will analyze the popular understandings of LGBTQ social movements by linking the context, goals, and outcomes of movements to the dynamics of race, class, gender, sexuality, ability, immigration status, and geography. Our goal will be to understand the ways that LGBTQ social movements have helped influence as well as been influenced by existing social and governmental institutions. How have these relationships determined the perceived legitimacy of such movements? We will also examine several contemporary issues that have inspired LGBTQ organizing and advocacy.",
