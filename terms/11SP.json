We will examine how Greek literature and thought influenced Roman ideas about love, as well as how Latin authors shaped the course of love poetry and songs in the West. We will also consider a range of topics related to love in antiquity, including sexuality, gender, courtship rituals, marriage, and children.",

The second half will equip students with the basic skills needed to engage ancient Latin poetry, including meter, genre, rhetorical devices and poetic tropes, as encountered in selections from Ovid's mythological epic, Metamorphoses.",

This class focuses on the theology of the Protestant Reformation, and traces its legacy in the modern world. We read Luther, Calvin, and Anabaptists, exploring debates over politics, church authority, scripture, faith, and salvation. We then trace the appropriation of these ideas by modern thinkers, who draw upon the perceived individualism of the Reformers in their interpretations of religious experience, despair, freedom, and secularization.",

In the first part of the course, we concentrate on gathering notation and terminology intended to allow an explicit and manageable description.

Weekly class critiques will help students develop formal approaches, audio and visual language, and work flows specific to their projects. As students enter the production and post-production phases, further critiques will help them shape their material for the greatest, most precise expression. Students may enroll in this course multiple times. Prior to registering for the course, students must submit a project proposal to the instructor. Please contact instructor for further information. Final enrollment is based on the quality of the proposal.",

As we situate this genre within its literary and historical context, we will consider its relationship to realism and Romanticism, and we will explore how it reflects the political and cultural anxieties of the age.

We will explore some of the different literary genres that emerged in the New Arab courts and urban centers: from wine and love poetry, historical and humorous anecdotes, to the Thousand and One Nights, and discuss the socio-historical forces and institutions that shaped them. All readings are in English. No Arabic knowledge required.",
