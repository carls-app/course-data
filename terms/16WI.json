There are certain features of human intellection, subjective experience, and action which have prompted some philosophers to argue that human mental activity is not reducible to brain activity. Some have gone on to argue that the human mind is immaterial and capable of surviving the death of the body. We will examine variants of these views as well as objections to them, reading selections from such historical figures as Plato, Aristotle, and Descartes, and such contemporary philosophers as Churchland, Nagel, and Searle.",

How much of human life, for example, can be explained with biology and other kinds of natural science? How do culture, education, and ethnic identity shape who we are? What role should pleasure play in human life? What is the best way to address difference and disagreement within a political community? The first part of the course includes a wide variety of answers to these questions, both modern and historical. Topics will include Jean-Paul Sartre's existentialist approach to freedom, the debate between Confucian thinkers Mencius and Hsun Tzu about whether human nature is good or evil, and recent work on participatory democracy by Anne Phillips. In the last few weeks of the course, we will apply concepts and philosophical skills from the first section to a longer text, Plato's Gorgias, a complex dialogue that gives sustained and surprising answers to the questions raised earlier.",

But the primacy of patient autonomy as a value raises a host of interesting questions: What can (or should) clinicians do when patients make poor decisions? What does it mean for a patient to be competent? Who should make decisions in those cases where the patient is deemed incompetent or too young to make decisions for herself? This course examines these questions and, depending on interest, larger policy questions (like debates about organ markets) that revolve around the relationship between autonomy and paternalism.",

As we enter the twentyÂ­first century, the pervasiveness of law continues to grow. We begin this course by exploring the ubiquity of law and the implications of this for our dayÂ­toÂ­day lives. Next we examine definitions of law, the development of law, and the extent to which law is shaped by the wider social and cultural contexts in which it is embedded. We conclude by examining specific issues such as legal consciousness, the legal profession, and law and social inequality. Readings include classic and contemporary theoretical works on law and society, and current empirical applications.",

This seminar moves beyond conceptions of theory as explanation and generalization to explore the idea of theory as critique. Rather than examining the \"classical\" origins of social critique (Marx, Nietzsche, Freud), we'll choose a significant theme within current debates and explore it though a variety of contemporary critical perspectives. Possible themes include self and identity, equality and difference, class and power, ethics and justice. Schools of thought may include feminism, poststructuralism, postcolonialism, psychoanalysis, queer theory, Marxism. Key thinkers may include Seyla Benhabib, Pierre Bourdieu, Judith Butler, Michel Foucault, Jurgen Habermas, Donna Haraway, Axel Honneth, Julia Kristeva, Paul Ricoeur, Edward Said, Dorothy Smith.",

We will pay particular attention to the creative ways that indigenous communities have remained vibrant in the face of ongoing colonial struggle. Topics include histories of Indian-settler relations, American Indian sovereignties, Indigenous ecological knowledge practices, American Indian philosophical and literary traditions, and American Indian activism.",

Through following a thread from scripture, through the interpretive sciences (chiefly law and theology), and into an analysis of Muslim life in the contemporary world, students will explore answers Muslim thinkers have given to major questions of our shared existence, with both fidelity to the texts and flexibility to present demands. Though the focus of this course is not on Islam's role in current events, through attaining a solid introduction to the tradition--its sociology, its history, and its modes of reasoning--students will attain the knowledge necessary to begin to engage those events with a critical and informed mind.",

But, where do those ideas and feelings come from, and how have they both reflected and shaped American cultural, political and environmental history over the last four centuries? These are the central issues and questions that we will pursue in this seminar.",

Since this formative period the quest for stability in the Middle East has proved elusive. Many ills still plaguing the region today find their roots in the dynamics of the era under study.

London and Seville will provide rich and unique opportunities to learn how sport and society intersect. With classroom activities, site visits, field trips to matches, museums, and stadiums students will examine sport from an historical and cultural perspective while keeping in mind how our globalized world impacts sport. Lastly, we will seek to understand ways athletics can break down barriers and create understanding between others.",

It can be argued that animals face a relatively small set of basic challenges: they must acquire food, water, and mates, and they must avoid danger. Yet we see a rich diversity of solutions to these problems. Consider foraging behavior, for example. All animals must acquire energy, but some filter particles out of sea water, others graze on nearly inedible grasses, while still others hunt in cooperative packs. In this course we will consider such topics as foraging, communication, sociality, and conflict. By focusing on the functions and evolutionary histories of behaviors, we strive to better understand the puzzle of behavioral diversity.",

Focusing on the Judeo-Christian formulations of idolatry this course draws on a range of media, from the Hebrew Bible to the bones of saints and popular prints, as we analyze verbal and visual representations of the sacred and the profane. The driving questions will be: how have idols and idolaters been recognized in the past, and how have these various textual and visual formulations of idolatry shaped works of art from the ancient, medieval, and early modern worlds?",
