	"summary": "This class focuses on the cultural manifestations of social fragmentation brought to Peru by the uneven development resulting from increasing insertion of both \"traditional\" and \"modern\" sectors of society into global capitalism. We will examine a variety of cultural artifacts simultaneously and indelibly marked by traditional-popular culture and by the changing effects of mass-media culture and technology. Classes will be supplemented by visits to relevant sites and events, and lectures by local experts.",
