	"summary": "Students are familiarized with street dance vocabulary and fundamentals. Emphasis on \"finding your rhythm\" through bodily awareness. Beginners can expect an aerobic workout until their movement becomes looser and more efficient. Excellent for core strength, balance and flexibility. The lessons are 70 minutes each and consist of a group warm-up (ten minutes), stretching (five minutes), hip-hop vocabulary (fifteen minutes), house vocabulary (twenty-five minutes), and choreography (fifteen minutes). No experience necessary.",
