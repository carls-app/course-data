	"summary": "The course begins as Europe's African empire unraveled, and ends with a look toward the future. Students engage in this history while joining the professor in the project of compiling a textbook collection of primary sources. The course is organized thematically into units. Each begins with research on and critical discussion of a broad topic considered within specific historical contexts. Students will identify, edit, and comment on primary sources that represent these major developments and themes. The class will assemble their collection into a narrative collage consisting of official documents, political commentaries, interviews, memoirs, transcripts, and visual records.",
