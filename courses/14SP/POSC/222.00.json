In this course we will learn about and reflect upon the political aspects of food in the U.S. Topics include food history, agribusiness, local food movements, food policy, and social justice. What influences the way we eat? How did ignorance about food become the norm in the U.S.? The course will include guest speakers and possibly field trips.",
