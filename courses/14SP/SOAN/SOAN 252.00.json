	"summary": "The great majority of the modern Middle East was born in the aftermath of WWI and breakdown of the Ottoman Empire. Iran was an exception as it lay outside the Ottoman fold, but in many respects its modern history developed in tandem as it reacted to the same influences. This course examines the state and society in the Middle East from the early nineteenth century to the present. Particular attention is paid to Turkey, Iran and Egypt, that are here approached comparatively.",
