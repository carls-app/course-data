	"summary": "This course will focus on the organization of the health care system in the United States and its impact on women's health. We will explore the politics of women's health from the perspective of women of different races, ethnicities, classes and sexual orientations. Gender and the social construction of health and illness, and women's activism (as consumers and health care practitioners) shall frame our explorations of menstruation, sexuality, nutrition, body image, fertility control, pregnancy, childbirth, and menopause. We will focus on the medicalization of these processes and explore alternatives that center on reproductive justice.",
