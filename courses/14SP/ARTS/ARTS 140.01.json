	"summary": "Study nature aesthetics and examine your assumptions about the landscape photograph. Question the formal, moral and biological implications of your \"framed view-point,\" as you move your lens across the prairies, woods and farmer's fields of Northfield. Reflect on the ways in which nature has been visually represented in the classroom, creating a three-way intersection between art, science and technology. In particular, what are the effects of two-dimensional representation on our estrangement from nature itself? Demonstrations, readings, discussions and field trips will help the student create a final portfolio of digital prints and text. Student must provide their own digital camera.",
