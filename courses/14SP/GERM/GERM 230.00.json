A similarly profound revolution is taking place today with the use of computers. This course focuses on the major developments in printing since 1450 against the relevant historical and social background. In addition to lectures and discussions there is a weekly \"lab,\" in which students will gain first-hand knowledge of such techniques as woodcutting, engraving, etching, lithography, bookbinding, and papermaking.
