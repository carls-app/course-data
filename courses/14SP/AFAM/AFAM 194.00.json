	"summary": "Since the 1960s, the black middle class has been an object of debate and interest, both among scholars and in society. In this course, we will examine the black middle class from an interdisciplinary perspective, specifically considering questions and problems posed in economics, sociology, history and literature. Among other topics, we will examine when and how the black middle class emerged, its distinctiveness from its white and working-class counterparts, and its implications and larger meaning in popular culture and public discourse about race, class, and American society.",
