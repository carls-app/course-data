	"summary": "This course explores the history of the samurai, focusing on its connection with Japanese religion and culture. We will study how the warrior class emerged and formed its own government in medieval Japan, leading to rule by the Tokugawa shogunate, and investigate the origins of the purported ideals of the samurai--loyalty, honor, self-sacrifice, and even death--as represented most famously in the ritual suicide of \"harakiri.\" We also will consider developments in the modern era, when samurai ethics was both embraced and criticized as the icon of Japanese national identity, as seen in films, novels, and other sources.",
