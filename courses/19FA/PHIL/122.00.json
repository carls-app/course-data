	"summary": "Leaders who face tragedy and violence inspire others with their personal narratives of self-creation and meaning-making. This course invites students to investigate the relationship between the subjective meaning-making experience and various manifestations of the ‘problem of evil’. We will read a variety of texts that highlight narrative experiences of tragedy, self-transformation, and models of leadership as empowerment. The course approaches these topics from a variety of philosophical lenses including: Existentialism, Feminist Philosophy, Africana Philosophy, Queer Studies, Disability Studies, and Religious Studies. The texts of this course will include:\n     \n      Book of Job\n     \n     , Victor Frankl’s\n     \n      Man’s Search For Meaning\n     \n     , Lucy Delaney’s\n     \n      From the Darkness Cometh the Light\n     \n     , Susan Brison’s\n     \n      Aftermath: Violence and the Remaking of the Self\n     \n     , and Eli Clare’s\n     \n      Exile and Pride\n     \n     .",
