We will learn about physical, cognitive, and psychosocial developmental milestones and challenges unique to each stage of human development. This exploration “from womb to tomb” includes infancy, early and middle childhood, adolescence, emerging adulthood, adulthood, and old age. Through readings, class discussions, and group and individual activities, students will have the opportunity to apply the concepts we are learning to the world around us.",
