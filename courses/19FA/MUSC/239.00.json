	"summary": "What Is Music? What exactly is a \"musical composition,\" especially in the age of recorded music and sampling? How is music meaningful? Can music tell a story? Express an emotion? Induce an emotion (and if so, what kind)? Convey a proposition? And if music can do any of these things, how does it do it? To explore these questions, we will discuss readings by contemporary musicians and philosophers, and musical examples ranging from Mozart to Muddy Waters and from Beethoven to the Beatles.",
