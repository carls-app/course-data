	"summary": "What is a body? Who decides what is normal? What is beautiful? In this course, we will examine theories and portrayals of the body in art, literature, philosophy, and film. We will ask what comes to be known as natural or the norm and how deviations from that norm are represented. Ultimately, we may ask not simply what a body is, but what do bodies evoke? What can a body do? Works include visual art from Grünewald, Dürer, MadC; films from Wiene, Murnau, Sanders-Brahms; and readings from Rilke, Kafka, Bovenschen, Siebers, and Fuchs in English translation. Discussion in English.\n    \n\n     Held for new first year students",
