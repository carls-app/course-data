	"summary": "Wasn’t the Cold War something the U.S. and the USSR fought over? What does it have to do with Latin America, race, and sex? This global conflict was in fact not “cold” at all, as Latin American social movements, revolutionaries, and states fought over how to create a better society. Topics will include the Cuban Revolution, the global youth rebellions, dirty wars, drug wars, and the emergence of feminist, indigenous rights, LGBT rights, and anti-racist movements. The course will end by exploring how the violence of the Cold War helped create drug violence and gang warfare in the present day.",
