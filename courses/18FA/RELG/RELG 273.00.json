	"summary": "As the inevitable conclusion of every human existence, our lives are profoundly shaped by death. Consequently, we are all in the process of\n     \n      approaching\n     \n     \n      death\n     \n     â€”both our own and that of others. This course examines the stunning variety of ways in which humans have approached death and mortality throughout history and across the globe. We will (1) develop a vocabulary of human mortality and death that will allow us to (2) illuminate the structural and functional continuities/discontinuities present across human approaches to death and (3) think critically about mortality and death as we approach them in our own lives.",
