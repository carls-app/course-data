	"summary": "In this class we explore how religious thinkers have interrogated and re-imagined the concept \"God\" in response to a range of modern intellectual, political, and cultural challenges to traditional faith. Focusing particularly on contemporary (post-WWII) contexts, we consider the ways in which questions related to secularization, social justice, oppression, and religious pluralism have prompted theologians to re-define the very meaning of the word \"God\" and the nature of God's power, agency, and relation to human communities. As we encounter these conceptions of God, we examine and assess the definitions of power, truth, and human fulfillment that undergird them.",
