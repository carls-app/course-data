	"summary": "Stop-motion animation exists at the intersection of cinema, dance, and sculpture. In this class, students will experiment with a variety of front-of-camera animation techniques to build sensitivity and gain proficiency in this unique manipulation of materials and time. We will explore clay, object, and hinged-paper puppet traditions as well as other sculptural methods. Exercises will emphasize movement strategies and cinematic concerns such as mise-en-scene and figure-ground relationships as they relate specifically to stop motion. Students will each pitch and complete a final animation project exploring these concepts in depth.",
