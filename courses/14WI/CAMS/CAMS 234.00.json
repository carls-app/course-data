	"summary": "Mentored by Tarkovsky, influenced by the German Expressionists Dovzhenko and Bresson, but essentially self-made as a director, Aleksandr Sokurov delights and perplexes viewers with cinematic canvases of exceptional beauty and emotion. He also offers us a media sandbox for analyzing everything from screenplay writing to sound production, from painting to photography, and theories of visuality in-between. Of Sokurov's 57 films (documentary and fiction) made over 30 years and already influencing younger directors around the world we will focus on those grouped around his \"power\" cycle. In-class analyses, short writing assignments. No knowledge of Russian language or Russian studies required.",
