	"summary": "Provides students with essential skills for producing and publishing forceful, effective visual communication. We focus on the combination of typography and image in formats such as graphic-intensive print-style publications, posters, still and motion-based typography. Production tools are primarily digital, including Photoshop, Adobe InDesign, Apple iWorks, LiveType and OmniGraffle. Unlike traditional pre-professional graphic design classes that teach a \"design vocabulary,\" this class is predicated on the notion that the best design evolves from one's own specific, real-world design problems. Students read widely in the emerging literature of visual communication and the visualization of information.",
