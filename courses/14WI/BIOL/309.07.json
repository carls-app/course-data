	"summary": "Australia has a remarkable diversity of terrestrial vertebrates, including many marsupials, lizards, and snakes. These animals span a wide array of reproductive strategies, and we will consider the evolutionary pressures that produce differences in reproductive morphology, physiology, and behavioral ecology of a variety of Australian vertebrates. Why do some species give birth while others lay eggs? What environmental conditions favor territoriality? How do environmental cues initiate the reproductive season? A thorough understanding of the ultimate and proximate mechanisms that shape the vast diversity of vertebrate reproductive traits requires an interdisciplinary approach, which we will pursue in field research projects.",
