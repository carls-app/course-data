	"summary": "The course will examine the biochemical basis of human disease. Although the focus will be on common diseases such as metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes, rare but instructive conditions will also be examined. An analytical approach, based on primary literature, will be used and the emphases will be placed on critical evaluation of experimental design and data interpretation.",
