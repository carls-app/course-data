	"summary": "Students are introduced to this fast-paced racquet sport. Played on a court similar to racquetball, squash involves eye-hand coordination and quick reflexes. In general, the smaller squash ball and longer squash racquet create a game faster and more reactive than its relative, racquetball. This class will cover basic stroke production, rules and strategies of the game. Geared toward beginners, all equipment is furnished",
