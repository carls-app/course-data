The theme of this year's course is \"From Household Tales to Hollywood: German Fairy Tales and Their Cinematic Adaptations.\" This course juxtaposes some of the Grimm Brothers' most influential, fascinating, and disturbing fairy tales with their popular transformations on the screen. We will discuss the roles of Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm as authors and collectors of folk tales in the nineteenth century, and explore other European and Arabic influences on the German MÃ¤rchen tradition.",
