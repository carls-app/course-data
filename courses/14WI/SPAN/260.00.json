	"summary": "This course examines nature and its relationship to Latin American identity across the last 200 years, but with emphasis on the twentieth century. Paradise regained and lost, monster or endangered habitat, nature plays a central role in Latin American development and its literature. Its literary image has varied greatly in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, at times suggesting the lost Garden of Eden, at other times mirroring human cruelty, and recently coming center stage in the ecological novel. Among the authors studied in this course are Sarmiento, Quiroga, Gallegos, Rulfo, Seplveda, Belli, and Montero.",
