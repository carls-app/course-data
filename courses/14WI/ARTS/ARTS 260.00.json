	"summary": "The course serves as an introduction to the language of painting. Students develop a facility with the physical tools of painting--brushes, paint and surfaces--as they gain a fluency with the basic formal elements of the discipline--color, form, value, composition and space. Students are also challenged to consider the choices they make in determining the content and ideas expressed in the work, and how to most effectively convey them.",
