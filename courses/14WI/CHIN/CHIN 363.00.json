This course will provide instruction and practice in speaking, reading, and writing about fundamental concepts from natural sciences, social sciences, humanities, and the arts. Students will learn to read and discuss the kind of non-specialist works that any well-educated speaker can comprehend, and will also receive a foundation that can lead to more specialized work. Specific topics to be covered will depend on the interests of students in the class.",
