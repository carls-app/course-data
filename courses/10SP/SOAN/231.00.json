	"summary": "This class studies transnational migration and global diasporas. Students will learn theoretical perspectives on contemporary migration, transnational linkages, and the imaginative connections maintained by globally dispersed peoples. Special attention will be paid to the global flow of people across national boundaries and the ways in which dispersed peoples build and maintain social networks across national borders. As such, the course considers: the reasons that impel people to move about the globe, the ways that diaspora and transnational social identities are constructed among globally dispersed peoples, and the challenges that new social formations pose to the nation-state.",
