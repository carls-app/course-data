	"summary": "Since 1962 A.B. Yehoshua has been one of Israel's most prolific, politically engaged, and internationally significant authors. A combination of Middle Eastern and Sephardic (medieval Spanish) Jewish family roots and a Western Zionist education has fueled provocative literary interpretations of the Jewish State's historical origins and many internal fault lines. We will examine Yehoshua's portrayals of Jewish ethnic and religious diversity and of Zionist national consciousness in medieval through modern Mediterranean and European contexts pre-1948. We will then view Israel's domestic East/ West, Jewish/ Palestinian, and religious/ secular divides through an artistic lens of exceptional, debatable historical scope. In English translation.",
