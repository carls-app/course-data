	"summary": "This course is designed for students who want to explore these 2-D media in greater depth. Students may choose to work exclusively in painting or drawing, or may combine media if they like. Some projects in the course emphasize strengthening students' facility in traditional uses of each medium, while others are designed to encourage students to challenge assumptions about what a painting or drawing can be. Two major assignments make up the core of the course--one focuses on art making as an evolving process and the other on a critical engagement with systems of visual representation.",
