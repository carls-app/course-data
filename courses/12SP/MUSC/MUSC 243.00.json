	"summary": "This course explores the sounds an sociocultural contexts of a number of Caribbean musics, usually including ska, reggae, salsa, calypso, soca, merengue, bachata, zouk and reggaeton. Popular, traditional, and sacred musics are included. While each island has unique and varied traditions, a number of themes relevant to Caribbean ethnomusicology connect them. In addition to our focused listening, we will read works by scholars, musicians, and critics addressing such themes as acculturation, race, class, ethnicity, politics, nationalism, and globalization, with the goal of understanding how these shape and are shaped by musical practice. No musical experience needed.",
