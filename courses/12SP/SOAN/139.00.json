	"summary": "All societies have what are considered to be \"social problems,\" but a sociological lens offers a unique approach to understanding and examining them. In this course, we consider social problems through three dimensions: who is affected by a social problem; how a social phenomenon becomes a \"social problem;\" and what kind of a problem it becomes. We consider particular contemporary social problems including the changing nature of work and the economy, contemporary changes in families and relationships, and gender and sexuality. We will also engage in debate about social problems and their solutions from different sociological perspectives.",
