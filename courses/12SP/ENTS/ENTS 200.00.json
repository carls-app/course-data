	"summary": "The production and consumption of food is a seemingly mundane activity in our lives. Yet, how we respond to food and our consumptive practices mirror our sense of place, our capacity for self-control, our health, the ways in which we impact the world food production system, and the natural environment. In this course, students will study modern agro-food systems and their social and ecological impacts in Ethiopia. The group will visit various sites throughout the program, including large and small scale farms, agro-forestry systems, and examples of urban agriculture.",
