	"summary": "Seneca the Younger was a key figure in the reigns of the Roman Emperors, Claudius and Nero. He was a prolific writer and a major force in shaping the moral philosophy of the later Roman world. This course will examine Seneca's thought and lively writing style by reading samples from a broad selection of his prose works (philosophical essays and letters) as well as his tragedies. There will be a short paper (six-eight pages) in addition to other assignments designed to familiarize students with some of the research tools and practices of the discipline.",
