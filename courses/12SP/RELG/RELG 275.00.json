	"summary": "Normative and descriptive accounts of the law, particularly in relation to politics, morality, and religion, will be the focus of this course. Philosophical literature, legal theory, ethnographies, political constitutions, human rights charters, court decisions, religious scripture, novels, and film will be studied in order to help us grasp how different traditions, from the Greek tragedians to American lawyers and artists, have distinguished the categories legal, political, moral, and religious from one another; understand how legal institutions and conceptions of the law shape our social reality; and articulate our own theories about how the phenomena in question relate, actually and normatively.",
