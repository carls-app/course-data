	"summary": "The Buddhist religion has been a central part of Asian cultures and societies since the third century BC. This course will trace the development of Buddhist art and architecture from its beginnings in India through its migration across the Asian continent. Attention will be paid to both the Mahayana and Theravada traditions in Central East, South, and South-East Asia. Special emphasis will be placed on the relationship between different doctrines, for example, Tantrism or Zen and the development of form and style.",
