	"summary": "This course offers an introduction to German culture after 1945 through the lens of film. We will treat films over a broad range of topics, with a special emphasis on (1) the shifting angles from which filmmakers remember the Holocaust and World War II, (2) migration and multiculturalism, especially German-Turkish relations, and (3) reflections on the GDR past and on life in post-reunification Germany. The careful analysis of each film will be framed by a discussion of its socio-historical context, in order to reflect the unique manner in which cinema engages with historical, cultural and political debates. Taught in English.",
