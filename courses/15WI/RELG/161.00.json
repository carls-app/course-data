	"summary": "Since antiquity, the Hebrew Bible has been read through various lenses and made meaningful to communities of readers through a range of interpretive methodologies and techniques. In this introductory class, we will survey different genres of literature found in the Hebrew Bible and consider how interpreters, classical and modern, have read the text and found it relevant in their lives. We will also consider creative, artistic and political interpretations of the Hebrew Bible--poetry, fiction, film, visual art and public discourse--as we examine how the Bible has endured as a text, and inspired devotion, critiques, political and social movements. Requires no previous knowledge and will use sources in translation. Students with background in Hebrew, who wish to use their language skills, will have the opportunity to look at primary textual sources.",
