	"summary": "How are we socially conditioned to see? In an age of self documentation, how do images construct individual and collective identities? This course is a study in visual culture and a practice in \"unseeing,\" or rethinking the way we look at images as artifacts of historical, political, and social discourse. It traces the cultural work of images throughout nineteenth- and twentieth century U.S. history by focusing on three types: postcards, photographs, and cartoons. Working with the Carleton archives, this course introduces students to interdisciplinary research by exploring how American studies scholars use and redefine visual archives in the twenty-first century.",
