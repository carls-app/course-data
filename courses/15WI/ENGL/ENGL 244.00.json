Particular attention is paid to the relationship between literature and stagecraft (\"page to stage\"). By tackling the complexities of prosody, of textual transmission, and of Shakespeare's highly figurative and metaphorical language, the course will help you further develop your ability to think critically about literature. Note: non-majors should register for English 144.",
