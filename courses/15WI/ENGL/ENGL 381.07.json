With London as our classroom, we will explore the flourishing and floundering of the British Empire through Victorian architecture, arts, and literature. Readings include works by Charles Dickens, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, Lewis Carroll, and Virginia Woolf. Field trips include visits to the Tate Britain, Victoria and Albert Museum, British Library, Sir John Soane's Museum, Kensington Palace, Leighton House, and the Royal Pavilion at Brighton.",
