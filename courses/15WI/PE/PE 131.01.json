	"summary": "This course is designed to give men and women the opportunity to play ice hockey together in a fun and non-competitive setting. Absolutely no body checking or rough play is allowed. Skill development in skating, stick handling, passing and shooting is stressed as well as position play and rules necessary to ensure the safety of the participants. Helmets are recommended and furnished. Students must provide their own skates and hockey sticks. Highly accomplished or \"hard-core\" hockey players have no place in this class.",
