	"summary": "In this course, students will work in collaboration with Danish art and design collective N55, who have been invited to campus as part of the Lucas Lectureship in the Arts. N55's practice embraces a critical investigation of how public spaces function in our contemporary era. Who has access to public space? Who has the right to build, and where? What is an environmentally ethical way to occupy the land? This winter, students will work alongside N55 to develop a speculative proposal for some aspect of the Carleton campus and will fabricate models or prototype structures to support this innovative scheme.",
