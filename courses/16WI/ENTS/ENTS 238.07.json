	"summary": "This course will examine biodiversity conservation in an urban context. It will focus on the link between biodiversity and human well being, look closely at mechanisms for conserving biodiversity, and examine how context and scale matter when thinking about the different approaches to conservation. Students will explore these issues in Addis Ababa and Arusha. Through readings, discussions with local experts, and independent research they will develop a better understanding of the opportunities and obstacles towards creating livable cities.",
