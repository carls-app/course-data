This course will meet five times throughout the term to discuss Stephen Witt's \"How Music Got Free: The End of an Industry, the Turn of the Century, and the Patient Zero of Piracy.\" Our discussion will focus not only on the story of how the music industry was transformed by piracy over the last twenty years, but also what that transformation means for us as consumers: are we obligated to get our music in some ways and not in others?",
