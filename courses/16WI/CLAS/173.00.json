	"summary": "This course is an exploration of life, death, and entertainment in the ancient world, particularly in Rome. We will focus especially on how and why people take part in sporting events and on how sport intersected with gender, social class, and economic concerns in the ancient world. Topics include the history of sport, slavery and marginal groups, demography, gladiatorial and combat events, and entertainment and politics. Our primary focus in lecture and discussion will be interpretation of a variety of ancient sources, but we will also evaluate modern views of ancient entertainment.",
