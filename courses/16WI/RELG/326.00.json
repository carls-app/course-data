	"summary": "Two vexing questions: What is post-colonial thought? And: What is religion? These will guide us as we look at the literary and theoretical production that, we may find, expresses the post-colonial imagination. We will use our guiding questions as a way of exploring a variety of problems both raised by and manifested in these works, such as: the nature of identity; the question of nationalism; the writing of history; questions of class, gender, and race. The emphasis will be on close readings of these works which emerge from the crucible of the Third Worlds \"encounter\" with European and American colonialism.",
