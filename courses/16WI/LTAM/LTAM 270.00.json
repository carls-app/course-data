This interdisciplinary course canvasses this tumultuous era and its aftermath through the study of historical sources, literature, film, photography, and music. It explores the rise and fall of Allende, life and repression under the dictatorship, the protest movement against military rule, and the ongoing struggles and debates over human rights, justice, and collective memory.",
