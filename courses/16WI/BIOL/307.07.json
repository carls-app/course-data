	"summary": "The evolutionary histories of Australia and New Zealand are unique because of their relative isolation from other continental land masses. This course will explore the biogeography of these areas, with emphasis on the evolutionary diversification of endemic lineages of organisms including mammals (such as marsupials), birds (such as moas), plants, and insects. Class research projects on site will examine how ecological interactions have evolved among these unique species, and how these interactions are being affected by the large number of introduced species now present",
