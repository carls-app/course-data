Our obsession has also inspired a bumper crop of new food prose: call it desk-to-table. \"Eat the Story\" will be a writing workshop, with a focus on foodways, heirloom crops, and community/urban ag. Our reading menu will draw on contemporary post-Pollan food journalism. (Depending on our appetite, we may visit with local food producers.) These samples will serve as fodder for our main course: practical field reporting and writing projects, from blog posts to longer features.",
