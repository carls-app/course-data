	"summary": "Although the Age of Beowulf ended almost one thousand years ago, its influence endures. Just as the CGI adaptation of Beowulf uses Old English--the language in England during this period--to mark the monstrous, the History Channel's Vikings uses this era as a historical backdrop, and Tolkien's LOTR finds much of its inspiration in Old English literature. In this class, then, we'll return to the source--to tales of demons, dragons, heroes, and saints found in various chronicles, poems, riddles, and more from the Age of Beowulf--and, hopefully, start to understand why this particular epoch looms so large. Texts will be read in modern translation.",
