	"summary": "This course will explore the history of England from the time of the Tudors through the Industrial Revolution,\u00a0with a particular focus on the history of poverty and\u00a0social welfare.\u00a0We will use new technologies to develop innovative ways to teach and learn about the past. Using a specially designed digital archive, students will construct life stories of paupers, politicians and intellectuals. One day per week, the class will work in a computer lab constructing 3-Dimensional, virtual institutions and designing computer game scenarios that utilize their research to recreate the lived experience of the poor.",
