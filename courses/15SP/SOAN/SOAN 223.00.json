	"summary": "Our love of sport is matched only by the belief that it is not worthy of deeper thought, inquiry, or critique. In this course we will work through theoretical approaches that help us understand the social phenomenon and its seemingly paradoxical position as both one of our most powerful and least respected institutions. We will then examine the way sport intersects with and shapes our understanding of important social issues such as gender, race, politics, nationality, and the human body. Our discussions will cover a wide-range of sports and physical practices ranging from the mainstream to the subcultural to the extreme.",
