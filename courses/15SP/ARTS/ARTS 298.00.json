	"summary": "Required for the studio major, and recommended for the junior year, this seminar is for student artists considering lives as producers of visual culture. The goal in this class is to develop a familiarity with important questions, both practical and theoretical, facing artists today. We will examine how art is disseminated, understood, and at times, misunderstood. Be prepared to read, write about, and discuss essays, criticism, and interviews covering a wide range of media, and visit artists' studios and exhibition venues. Students will help select topics, direct discussions, and organize a brief presentation about their own artistic development.",
