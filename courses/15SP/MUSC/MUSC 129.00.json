	"summary": "This course is devoted to deep listening and analysis of records illustrating the chief style trends and genres of rock's first three decades. During this period (1950s-1970s) popular music developed a new common language that bound together diverse stylistic and cultural elements through the medium of sound recording. We will trace the development of that language and its rhetorical elements through a series of guided listening projects.",
