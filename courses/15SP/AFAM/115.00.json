	"summary": "This course introduces students to a complex array of concerns facing African Americans from slavery to our contemporary moment. Engaging in close readings of texts from a variety of genres that capture the dynamics of African American experiences, several questions will guide our efforts as we attempt to make sense of African American praxis today. Examples are: What does agency look like in conditions of bondage and systematic disenfranchisement? What does the adjective, Black, mean when we talk about black culture or the Black Church?",
