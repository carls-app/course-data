	"summary": "How did images reflect and shape popular attitudes towards the events and issues of the American Civil War? This seminar will investigate various visual media, ranging from printed ephemera to fine art, seeking answers to this question. The course will analyze reportage and artworks portraying specific events, such as the Battle of Gettysburg and the assassination of President Lincoln, as well as examine pictorial treatments of subjects such as slavery and emancipation, secession and union, military camp life and the home front. Later thematic directions for the course will be influenced by individual student research projects.",
