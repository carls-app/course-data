	"summary": "\"The old cinema is dead! We believe in a new cinema!\" This bold declaration, signed by a group of German filmmakers at the Oberhausen Film Festival in 1962, marks a radical break with German postwar film. Influenced by the French New Wave and the 1968 student protests, the directors of New German Cinema created works that were both artistically ambitious and socially critical. We will discuss iconic films of this period by directors such as Fassbinder, Herzog, Schl√∂ndorff, and Wenders, and contrast their vision with the politics and aesthetics of a later generation of German filmmakers, the Berlin School. Conducted in German.",
