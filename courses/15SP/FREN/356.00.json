	"summary": "From the libertine novels of the Marquis de Sade to the decadent tales of Rachilde, the figure of the prostitute pervades French art and literature of the nineteenth-century. We find her various avatars (including the \"grisette\" and the \"courtisane\") in works by Balzac, Sand, Mérimée, Baudelaire, Flaubert, Dumas, Zola--not to mention in the art of Manet and others. In this class we'll investigate why these representations rise to prominence--and what they mean.",
