	"summary": "Legal documents such as depositions, file papers, complaints, accusations, confessions, and laws themselves offer a fascinating window into American history. Such documents lend themselves to the study of Indian history, capitalism, family relationships, and slavery, to name only a few possible topics. This is an advanced research seminar in which students will write a 25-30 page paper based on original research. Participation in the seminar will also include some common readings that use a variety of approaches to legal history, and extensive peer reviews of research papers.",
