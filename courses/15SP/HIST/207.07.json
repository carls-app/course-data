	"summary": "This course examines travel as an occasion for investigation, encounter, and reflection and as an opportunity to document and communicate these observations of people and place. Through readings drawn from a range of disciplines and genres, site visits, and ongoing discussion, we will examine the traveler as witness, observer, and recorder, and the implications of genre for travel writing. We will also examine the nature of public memory and commemoration and the role of travelers as audiences for sites of memory. As part of the course, students will maintain their own travel journals and contribute to the Program Blog.",
