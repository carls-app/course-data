	"summary": "This is a two-track course that focuses, on one hand, on specific problems resulting from the conflict between strong economic growth and the persistence of social inequality and marginalization. On the other hand, the class will explore the difficulties of creating forms of participatory politics, against the background of key moments in Peru's political history. The emphasis will be on present-day manifestations of the polarity \"formal\" vs. \"real\" democracy.\" A political scientist and a sociologist lead the class, and classes are supplemented with lectures by experts on specific issues.",
