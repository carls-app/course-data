	"summary": "Many well-known Russian writers also wrote literature for children. Some sought new ways of educating; others sought refuge from the constraints of censorship. Some incorporated themes from folklore; others created new characters who became part of the literary culture shared by all Russians. This course will examine the evolution of Russian writing for children from the mid-nineteenth century to the present. Works by Tolstoy, Chukovskii, Zoshchenko, Olesha, Kharms, Marshak and others. Conducted in Russian.",
