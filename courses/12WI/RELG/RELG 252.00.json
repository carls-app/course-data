	"summary": "The Mahabharata, perhaps the longest epic poem ever composed, tells the story of a fratricidal war at the dawn of Indian history. It is an inexhaustible source of Hindu mythology, religion, philosophy, psychology, ethics, political theory, and social thought. We will study both the broad outlines and particular sections of the Mahabharata, including its most famous episode, the Bhagavad Gita. We will explore the epic both in its traditional context and through modern artistic re-creations. Throughout, we will seek to understand what the Mahabharata tells us about the enduring values, and notions of war and peace, found in Indic civilization.",
