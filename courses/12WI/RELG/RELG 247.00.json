	"summary": "We will explore the origins, existential, and ethical dimensions of Rhythm and Poetry (RAP) music. Giving attention to RAP songs written and produced by African American artists, including Tupac, Nas, Cee-lo Green, Dante Smith, Michael Franti, The Roots, and Lauryn Hill, we will analyze their work with an interest in understanding the conceptions of God and the good reflected in them, and how these conceptions connect to and reflect African American cultural practices. Weekly, we will read one theoretical, biographical, or sociological book and listen to one album. Assignments will include book review essays, music reviews, and a final paper.",
