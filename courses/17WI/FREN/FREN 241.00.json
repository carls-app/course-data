	"summary": "French lyric poetry occupies a privileged position in the literary landscape of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. However, it also shares a common heritage with less literary siblings, such as popular music and even advertising. Starting with the study of such poets as Lamartine, Desbordes-Valmore, Baudelaire, Mallarm\u00e9, Val\u00e9ry, and Bonnefoy, we will also investigate poetic techniques in popular songs and contemporary ads. Conducted in French.",
