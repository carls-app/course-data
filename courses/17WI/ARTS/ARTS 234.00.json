	"summary": "This course is an introduction to the figurative and narrative potential of clay as a sculptural medium. Through hands-on demonstrations, lectures, readings, and assignments students will develop an understanding of both contemporary and historical approaches to forming the human figure in clay. The relationship artists have with the human body is complex and has been the subject of religious, philosophical and personal investigation for centuries. This course will analyze this relationship while developing technical skills in construction and firing techniques specific to ceramics.",
