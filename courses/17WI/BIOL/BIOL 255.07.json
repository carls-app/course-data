	"summary": "In this course students will learn about the natural history of the Australian landscape and the cultural history of the people who have settled there. We will specifically consider the role of sustainability in Aboriginal, colonial, and modern Australian cultures. The majority of work for this class will be reading selected works that showcase central concepts. This reading should be completed before the program begins, and work will be evaluated through written work. In Australia, students will learn through lectures and cultural immersion, and they will synthesize what they learn in reflective essays.",
