	"summary": "The Colloquium is designed to introduce and consolidate the research and interpretive skills required in the highly interdisciplinary study of Classical antiquity. Meeting weekly, three two-week modules will be organized around the main areas identified in the Classics major requirements—historical analysis, literary analysis, archaeological analysis—in order to solidify skills in finding, reading/interpreting, and citing evidence and sources from, and about, the Classical world. Additionally, students will choose a Symposium theme for the following year and generate a common bibliography pertaining to the topic of the Symposium. Students will also draft a Call for Papers and identify potential Symposium respondents.",
