	"summary": "This course examines the ways in which economic goods are embedded in social relations. When does a thing become a commodity? What relationships exist between culture and ecology? Formulating an anthropological perspective for the interpretation of \"economic facts,\" we will examine similarities and differences among hunter-gatherers, horticulturalists, and peasants. We will also discuss the interpretation of traders in the brokering of culture, asymmetrical articulation of local and transnational economies, gender bias in classical exchange theory, Mauss on gift-giving and Marx on \"commodity fetishism.\" Theoretical material will be illustrated with ethnographic examples from Africa, Asia, Oceania, and the Americas.",
