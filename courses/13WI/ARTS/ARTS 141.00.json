	"summary": "In this course we will explore the rich history of photography's experimental development through the use of light and chemistry. Our focus will be on black and white darkroom experimentation and color scanning and digital printing. Demonstrations will cover a wide range of materials and techniques such as; the making of pin hole cameras, paper negatives, photograms, photomontages, and the use of toning, solarization and liquid emulsion on paper and glass. Students will create a portfolio and recipe book of their experimental investigations.",
