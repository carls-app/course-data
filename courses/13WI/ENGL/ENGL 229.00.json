	"summary": "Post-Civil War writers refashioned the cultural work of fiction to express the new taste for realism and the even more chastened mode of naturalism. The novels of this period have a documentary feel, as though charged with representing and re-envisioning the drama of real American lives in a disenchanted, industrialized, and rapidly consolidating world. Readings from Howells, James, Crane, Jewett, Gilman, Dreiser, Chesnutt, and Wharton.",
