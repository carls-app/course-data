	"summary": "Smallholder agriculture is the mainstay of livelihoods in much of Sub Saharan Africa. In east Africa, for example, smallholder farming accounts for about seventy-five percent of agricultural production and over seventy-five percent employment. Yet the productivity of the sector is very low to the point that famine is a recurrent phenomenon. In this course, students will study the structure of the smallholder farming communities, the economic and institutional constraints under which these farmers operate, and current efforts to address them. The group will explore these issues at various sites throughout the program.",
