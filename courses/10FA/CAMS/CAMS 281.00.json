	"summary": "This production class in digital photography explores using images to describe and narrate the world around us. Students will learn to master their digital camera, develop an eye for composition and photographic style, learn advanced techniques in Photoshop, and then apply these skills in creating a photo essay about topics in the community or on campus, and publish theses online or in print. Additionally, students will create fictional photographic stories based on existing short fiction, their own stories, or other experimental forms. This class offers a solid foundation for those interested in digital imaging, visual documentary, moving image storytelling, and photojournalism. Digital camera required.",
