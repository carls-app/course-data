	"summary": "With an emphasis on the linking of language, culture, and social context, this course introduces linguistic anthropology. We begin by looking at its roots in linguistics, anthropology, semiology and semiotics. Then we introduce the central concepts of speech community, communicative competence, and language functions. We explore both classic studies (e.g., terms of address; linguistic relativity; language variation) and contemporary research (e.g., ritual performance; political economy of language; language socialization; social contexts of literacy; language ideologies; language endangerment). We will read ethnographic material from the United States (e.g., Hmong, Apache) and the world (e.g., Indonesia, Africa). Students will also do field observations of language practice in their own communities.",
