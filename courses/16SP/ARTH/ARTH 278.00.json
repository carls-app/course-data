	"summary": "Exhibitions can reveal, question, provoke, argue, and inspire. Combining objects, images, texts, space, and appealing to all five senses, the exhibition creates meaning through experience. How are successful exhibitions created? How do curators move from an initial idea to a fully realized exhibition? In this practicum, Gary Vikan '67, former director of the Walters Art Gallery in Baltimore, will collaborate with students to develop a 2016 fall term exhibition dedicated to Carleton's 150th Anniversary. Various college collections will provide material culture markers of the institution and its aspirations.",
