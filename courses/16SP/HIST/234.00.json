	"summary": "This course explores the dynamic interactions between three distinct centers of authority and power: the Roman papacy, the Church, and the heir to the legacies of Rome, the Holy Roman Empire from the tenth through thirteenth centuries. Among other topics to be covered: the rise of canon and Roman law; new religious orders; changing models of sanctity; the Church and local and 'national' identity; and the development of the papacy as a powerful, but controversial, European institution. The course will also consider the Holy Roman Empire as a cultural zone in which Church and Empire play vital roles as patrons and subjects.",
