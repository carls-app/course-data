	"summary": "This course explores the historical political, social, philosophical, and cultural problems related to mixed-race identity since the late nineteenth century, with emphasis on the U.S. government's 2000 decision allowing Americans to define their racial makeup as one race or more. Life stories, literature, and film investigate identity formation, stratification based on race, and the particular ways mixed-raced people articulate their identities in various contexts. Final projects beyond black and white mixed-race people encouraged.",
