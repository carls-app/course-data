	"summary": "In consultation with the director, students will work in pairs or groups of three to design an independent research project that demonstrates their knowledge of London. The projects will focus on particular London sites chosen by students--a street, a tube station, a city square, a store, a public artwork--the possibilities are vast. Student groups will design a presentation format (e.g., digital slideshow, poster board, artistic collage, etc.) and present their projects at the end of term.",
