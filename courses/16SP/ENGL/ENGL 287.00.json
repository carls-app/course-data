	"summary": "There have never been more platforms available to journalists--from Twitter to full-length films and everything in between. But each of these platforms has is own strengths and weaknesses as a way to communicate, and simply porting older forms like newspaper and magazine writing to new platforms is doomed to be unsatisfying to both storyteller and audience. We'll look at the tools and technologies available to today's journalists, identify how they might be most effectively deployed, and do case studies on some of the best work happening at the frontier of the media business.",
