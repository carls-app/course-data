	"summary": "A combination of background readings, guided site visits, and personal exploration will give students tools for seeing London itself as a multilayered text under constant expansion and revision. Starting from the city's pre-urban geology and the still visible structures of its Roman past, students will gain a sense of London's rich history, its esthetic inspiration for writers and artists, and its complex status as a global metropolis.",
