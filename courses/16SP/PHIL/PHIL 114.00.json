	"summary": "This course, a general introduction to philosophy, is arranged around two interrelated questions: \"What makes us who we are?\" and \"What is the best kind of life for a human being?\" These questions take many forms. How much of human life, for example, can be explained with biology and other kinds of natural science? How do culture, education, and ethnic identity shape who we are? What role should pleasure play in human life? What is the best way to address difference and disagreement within a political community? The first part of the course includes a wide variety of answers to these questions, both modern and historical. Topics will include Jean-Paul Sartre's existentialist approach to freedom, the debate between Confucian thinkers Mencius and Hsun Tzu about whether human nature is good or evil, and recent work on participatory democracy by Anne Phillips. In the last few weeks of the course, we will apply concepts and philosophical skills from the first section to a longer text, Plato's Gorgias, a complex dialogue that gives sustained and surprising answers to the questions raised earlier.",
