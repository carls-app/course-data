These issues may include the emergence of indigenous cosmopolitics in the Andean region, the workings of narco states and their networks, and the contemporary urban cultural production in major Latin American cities, among others. The course emphasizes the necessity of a multi-disciplinary and interdisciplinary research perspective for understanding the changing nature of Latin American Studies today. Designed by the faculty in Latin American Studies, the course will include regular guest lectures from among these faculty.",
