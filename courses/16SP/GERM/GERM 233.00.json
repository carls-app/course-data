	"summary": "Why would people want to make, much less steal, a bust of a long-dead German author? What could he have done that inspired such admiration? This class introduces students to Friedrich Schiller \"poet, philosopher, historian, and Carleton icon‚Äù with a focus on his groundbreaking dramatic work. We will analyze and occasionally also perform scenes from Schiller's contributions to the European stage, ranging from Storm and Stress plays to Classical and Romantic tragedies, to historical dramas. Students will consider Schiller's writings through the lenses of politics, family relationships, and revolution, and also explore his productive friendship with Goethe. Taught in English.",
