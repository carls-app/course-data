	"summary": "This course will explore the history and form of the British novel, tracing its development from the eighteenth century to the present. Among the questions that we will consider: What are our expectations for novels, and what makes them such a popular form of entertainment? How did a genre once considered a source of moral corruption become a legitimate, even dominant, literary form? Authors will likely include: Daniel Defoe, Jane Austen, Charlotte Bronte, Charles Dickens, Virginia Woolf, and Jean Rhys.",
