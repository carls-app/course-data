	"summary": "This course will focus in depth on political and historical patterns of Brazil's economic, social, and cultural development from colonial times to its current democracy. The Brazil case study offers a wealth of lessons concerning the contradictions and possibilities of economic, social, and cultural development in the world today. We will explore these lessons through literature, music, architecture, and the arts as they speak to the perils of the country's insertion into global capitalism and to its political history which reflects the difficulties of creating and deepening democracy and building centers of political authority in the context of growing social inequalities and industrialization.",
