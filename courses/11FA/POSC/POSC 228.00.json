	"summary": "Are human bodies the sites where political power is constituted and legitimized? Are they sites of resistance and change, through which the construction of alternative identities and forms of discourse is incited and made possible? Drawing on philosophical, historical, and literary resources this course will explore different ways in which human bodies become politically significant. While the course will take its leading idea from Foucault's notion of biopolitics, it will expand its approach in a direction that will include feminist perspectives, as well as prison memories from survivors and witnesses of totalitarian/authoritarian political regimes.",
