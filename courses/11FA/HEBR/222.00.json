	"summary": "This course delves into Israel's two major cities, comparing their history and character. How are Tel Aviv's founding Zionist ideals and the Middle Eastern realities that challenged them portrayed in Hebrew literature? Our literary and cultural studies engagement with Tel Aviv will prepare students for our similar exploration of Jerusalem with its much longer multicultural history. How have places in both cities inspired literary reflections on national identity and memory? How have Israeli authors reciprocally influenced people's views of these urban spaces and their national resonance? This course is part of the OCS Winter Break program, which involves two linked classes in fall and winter terms; this class is the first class in the sequence. In translation.",
