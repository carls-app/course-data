	"summary": "This course will survey the mechanisms of antibiotic activity from a biochemical perspective, covering the major classes of antibiotics along with their respective biological targets using a combination of lecture and discussion of recent literature. We will also explore strategies for antibiotic discovery including combinatorial and rational approaches, as well as the molecular origins of the current crisis in antibiotic resistance.",
