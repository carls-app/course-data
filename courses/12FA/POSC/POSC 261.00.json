	"summary": "This course will explore different ways in which Foucault sees power, not as domination and violence, but as necessarily connected to freedom, courage, and a culture of self-criticism. It will also explore Arendt's conception of freedom as being intrinsic to the human condition and her conception of power as form of concerted action, of solidarity. The main aim of the course will be to bring these two thinkers in dialogue with each other in ways that highlight that power requires freedom, while freedom has no reality in the absence of the actual capacities of the political subjects for free action.",
