	"summary": "Is it real? A concern with the interplay between reality and fiction rests at the heart of Magical Realism--a mode of discourse and a perspective on the problem of representation that informs a good many of the best known works in Latin American literature. This course will examine works in translation by authors such as Alejo Carpentier, Gabriel García Márquez, Julio Cortázar, Isabel Allende, Laura Esquivel. We'll close the course with a nod to those authors who reject Magical Realism as the primary mode of fiction in Latin American prose.",
