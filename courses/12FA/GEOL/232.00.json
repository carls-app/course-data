	"summary": "This course will focus on background needed to perform fieldwork in Belize. We will use sources from the primary literature, as well as borrowings from textbooks, to learn some basics about oceanography, tropical marine ecosystems, benthic marine organisms and their habitats, the Caribbean Sea, and global changes that are affecting these things. Students will work in teams to formulate research topics that they will then pursue during the two weeks of fieldwork over Winter Break. We may need to get together several times during Fall Term to practice snorkeling in the pool. This course is part of the off-campus winter break Belize Program, involving two linked courses in fall and winter terms. This course is the first class in the sequence.",
