	"summary": "We will study different conceptions of \"happiness,\" as well as the practices related to its pursuit, found in both Western and non-Western religions and philosophies, posing such questions as: Is \"happiness\" a universal concept, pursued in all cultures of all times? Does religion, as Marx argued, only provide \"illusory\" happiness? Can \"happiness\" be quantifiably measured? Is happiness a psychologically-, socially-, or genetically-determined condition? In probing these questions, we will analyze not only scholarly writings but also cartoons, novels, films, and TED talks, and critically examine our own definitions of \"happiness.\"",
