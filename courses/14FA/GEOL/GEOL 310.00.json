	"summary": "This course focuses on arctic and boreal ecosystem responses to climate warming during the twentieth century. The course is multidisciplinary and introduces students to components of high-latitude ecosystems, their interactions, and their responses to recent warming. Some topics include tundra and boreal vegetation, permafrost, sea ice, climate feedbacks, and wildlife. Reading, discussion, and presentation of scientific literature is expected. Labs are diverse, ranging from examination of time series imagery during the twentieth century to interpreting lake sediment core records extending back 14,000 years ago.",
