	"summary": "Socrates is revered as the fountainhead for much of Western philosophical thought, so why did a jury of 500 Athenian citizens condemn him to death in 399 BCE? While we tend to think of Socrates strictly as a philosopher, this course will focus more on the type of man he was, and the problems he presented to the city of Athens in the late fifth century. In short, we'll be doing some critical thinking about one of the world's great critical thinkers. Readings from Greek drama, history and philosophy.",
