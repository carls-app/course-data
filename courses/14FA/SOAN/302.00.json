	"summary": "This seminar examines the relationship between culture and human rights from an anthropological perspective. By asking \"who are indigenous peoples?\" and \"what specific rights do they have?\" this course introduces students to a comparative framework for understanding cultural rights discourse. Given the history of intolerance to difference, the seminar demonstrates the need to explore the determinants of violence, ethnocide, and exploitation routinely committed against the world's most marginalized peoples. At the same time, it also asks about the limits of tolerance, if human rights abuses are perpetrated under the banner of cultural pluralism. Students will analyze case studies drawn from Africa, Asia, and the Americas, as well as issues that cross-cut these regions. Prerequisite: Sociology and Anthropology 110, 111 or permission of the instructor; upper division coursework in anthropology, sociology, history or philosophy recommended.",
