	"summary": "In the study of gender, masculinity has been largely hidden as a social construct; yet masculinity informs and shapes nearly all aspects of social life. In this course, we examine how masculinity operates in institutions such as schools, the workplace, sports, and the family; in social interactions and identities in everyday life; and in popular culture, media, and national and social formations. As a socio-historical construct, there is not one, but multiple masculinities. We will therefore adopt a comparative, intersectional lens, examining how masculinity is simultaneously constructed through categories of difference such as race, nationality, class, and sexuality.",
