	"summary": "Students meet with instructor twice a week to take part in drills that emphasize stopping opponent's attacks and striking quickly with power. General self-defense habits will be discussed with an emphasis on escaping an unarmed assailant. Towards the end of term, students will move from low-contact drills to padded medium-contact drills to provide better training. Students need not have any prior self-defense experience to enroll.",
