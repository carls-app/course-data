	"summary": "An art museum collects artifacts as containers of history and culture, and as repositories of craftsmanship and aesthetics. This course, focusing on college and university collections, will entertain theoretical and historical questions while also orchestrating a winter term exhibition drawn from over 2600 works in the Carleton Art Collection. To bring into focus the special nature of college museums, students will highlight possible curricular uses of the collection. Class participants will identify objects and themes, write labels and plan publicity, and each will create a brief narrative video highlighting works from the collection.",
