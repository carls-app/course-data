	"summary": "\"If man devotes himself to art, much evil is avoided...\" This statement, on the divine nature of art, was penned by the German artist Albrecht D\u00fcrer. D\u00fcrer's artworks--his paintings, his drawings, his woodblock prints, and his engravings--have been construed to be some of the most theologically sophisticated, naturalistically rendered, theoretically informed, classically inflected, and socially engaged of the period we now refer to as the \"Renaissance.\" This thematically organized course will engage the work of Albrecht D\u00fcrer, around these issues. Discussions will be integrated with student presentations, analyses of primary and scholarly texts, and writing assignments.",
