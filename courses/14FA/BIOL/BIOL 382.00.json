	"summary": "The molecular basis of the structure, replication, stable inheritance, and expression of genetic material illustrated with examples from the primary literature. Topics include: DNA replication and recombination, chromosome stability, DNA mutation and repair, regulation of gene expression, methods of gene identification, and the impact of recombinant DNA technology on human genetics. Laboratory will focus on current techniques in molecular biology including: gene cloning, genome databases, DNA finger printing, DNA sequencing, and the polymerase chain reaction.",
