	"summary": "The acquisition of enough energy to power our lives will be one of the key scientific and technological issues of the twenty-first century and beyond. This course provides an overview of the physics of energy harvesting at an introductory level. We also consider the technological and socio-economic constraints as well as the environmental and sociological impact of different energy sources, and go on field trips to see real-world applications. There will be a major group project.",
