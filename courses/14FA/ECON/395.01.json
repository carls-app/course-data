	"summary": "Behavioral economics aims to increase the predictive power of economic models by incorporating insights from psychology. Experiments can be used to test hypotheses in this field, but they are a tool for studying a broad range of economic questions. This course will focus on the overlap between the two fields, but it can lead to behavioral projects that use pre-existing data or experimental projects that test predictions from non-psychological behavior. Topics are wide-ranging, but the seminar will focus on behavioral game theory, biases in individual decision making, and experimental design.",
