	"summary": "Gold, silver, and diamond--we wear these metals and others on our bodies every day. We will explore, from cradle to final product, the lifecycle of gold and other precious metals used in jewelry. One gold ring leaves behind 20 tons of toxic rubble on a mining site. Is this acceptable? We will critically consider these objects from perspectives that include the chemical, environmental, wilderness protection and recreation, artistic, social justice, and cultural. The course will include a focus on local copper-nickel mines proposed by PolyMet and Twin Metals near the Boundary Waters Canoe Area in northern Minnesota.",
