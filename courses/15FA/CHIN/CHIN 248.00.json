	"summary": "This course uses linguistic methodology to examine the structure of Modern Standard Chinese. Its purpose is to give students a greater insight into the systems and logic at the heart of the Chinese language, both to help them better appreciate the beauty and elegance of language structure, and to help them more effectively learn the language. Topics covered will include the sound system, word formation, syntax, and semantics. No prior experience with linguistics is necessary, but students should have studied at least a year of Chinese or its equivalent. Readings and discussion will be in English.",
