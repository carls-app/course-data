Our focus will be on black and white darkroom experimentation and color scanning and digital printing. Demonstrations will cover a wide range of materials and techniques such as; the making of pin hole cameras, paper negatives, photograms, photomontages, and the use of toning, solarization and liquid emulsion on paper and glass. Students will create a portfolio and recipe book of their experimental investigations.",
