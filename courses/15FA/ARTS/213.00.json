	"summary": "Drawing has always been characterized by two dominant narratives: one of appearance, the other of conception. In both cases, drawing can be defined as an engagement with the hand, the drawing material and the surface, with consideration given to a visual and/or conceptual subject. In this course we will develop both our perceptual and reflective skills through a series of projects that will challenge the student to explore and refine both traditional and unconventional drawing strategies. This course is part of the OCS winter break New York Program, involving two linked courses in fall and winter terms. This course is the first in the sequence.",
