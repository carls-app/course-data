	"summary": "This course examines the causes, methods and logic behind attempts to censor music by governments, commercial corporations and religious authorities through guided listening, reading, and writing assignments. Lectures focus on the \"entartete musik\" of Nazi Germany and the social realism of Stalinist Russia. A comparative examination of these two instances of systematic culture control leads to the formation of a definition for music censorship and suggests a methodology for the study of other examples. Contemporary cases of music censorship are then selected from a wide range of countries, including North Korea, Iran, South Africa, Afghanistan, and the United States.",
