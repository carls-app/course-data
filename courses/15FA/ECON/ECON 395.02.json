	"summary": "In this topics-based seminar, we explore the economics and business of professional sports, mostly (but by no means necessarily entirely) in the United States. We will examine a variety of topics, including the institutions that govern pro sports and its main interested parties, especially owners, professional athletes, fans, media, and local municipalities. To better understand these institutions, we apply models from various traditional fields in economics including industrial organization, labor economics, public finance, and behavioral economics. The ultimate objective is to achieve an advanced understanding of the sports industry, and to understand how economists use economic models to develop hypotheses testable with sports data.",
