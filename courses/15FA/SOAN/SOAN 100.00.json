	"summary": "We spend a substantial portion of our lives at work, and the jobs we hold shape our daily activities, personal identity, and social interactions. This course explores the meaning and experiences of work at four key life stages: adolescence, young adulthood, mid-life, and the elder years. At each stage we examine questions such as: is paid employment in the teenage years a good idea? If so, how does it affect schoolwork and well-being? Do the occupational aspirations of today's college students match the jobs available? How do people in mid-career balance work and family? What makes for a good retirement?",
