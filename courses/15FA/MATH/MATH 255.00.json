	"summary": "Covers sampling design issues beyond the basic simple random sample: stratification, clustering, domains, and complex designs like two-phase and multistage designs. Inference and estimation techniques for most of these designs will be covered and the idea of sampling weights for a survey will be introduced. This course will also teach methods for graphing complex survey data and exploring relationships in complex survey data using regression and chi-square tests.",
