	"summary": "What is love? This is a question that has been the focus of much discussion, writing, and research for millennia. Romantic love most often consists of both social bonding and sexual attraction; therefore both love and sex have been the focus of much research in both humans and animals. In this class we will examine love and sex from a neurobiological perspective, by reading and discussing empirical studies that explore the hormones, pheromones, neurotransmitters, and brain systems involved in love and analogous processes in non-human animals. Topics will include considerations of sex differences and societal views on sexuality.",
