	"summary": "In this seminar we will we explore how findings from cognitive psychology can be used to improve education. The course will cover three main areas. First we will review research on learning and memory and the effectiveness of different student study strategies, such as highlighting, rereading, and quizzing yourself. Then we will explore some metacognitive aspects of learning--what students know about their own thinking--and how motivation affects performance in school. Finally, we will discuss some current issues in education (do learning styles exist? are standardized tests good for education?) and examine research exploring those issues. Students will be asked to evaluate basic research and consider how such research can be applied to educational contexts.",
