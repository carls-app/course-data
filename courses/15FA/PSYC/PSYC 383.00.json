	"summary": "Gender rules operate and occur in almost all aspects of social life. Thus, an analysis of gender can inform most aspects of social psychology. In this course, we will systematically review and analyze psychological theory and empirical research related to gender roles, gender stereotypes, and power differentials in society. We will discuss how and why social norms are related to gender and influence the experiences of men and women. Topics will include historical and theoretical perspectives on gender, differentiation of sex versus gender, gender similarities and differences, masculinity, sexism, feminism, body image, and media influence. We will also discuss gender issues important to contemporary society such as sexual orientation, transgender identities, and intersectionality approaches.",
