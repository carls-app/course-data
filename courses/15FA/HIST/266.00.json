	"summary": "While Islam is often associated primarily with the Arab world, eighty percent of the world--Muslim population resides elsewhere. The countries of South Asia--particularly India, Pakistan and Bangladesh--are collectively home to the largest number of Muslims. We will explore the expansion of Islam into South Asia, and look at specifically Indian forms of Islam. Our topics will include Muslim relations with non-Muslim communities, the Mughal Empire, colonial rule, gender and Islam, non-violent Islamic movements, Islamic art and architecture, jihad in history, Sufism, and Islamic notions of justice. Our class materials will include scholarly writings, poetry, music, slides, and film.",
