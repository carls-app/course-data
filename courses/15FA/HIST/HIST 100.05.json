This course examines historians' attempts to understand alcohol's powerful impact on American politics, society, social reform, and the history of medicine. Using original source materials, this course will focus on the temperance movement, the rise of saloons and saloon politics, the debate over prohibition, and the contemporary debates about substance abuse, Alcoholics Anonymous, and MADD (Mothers Against Drunk Drivers).",
