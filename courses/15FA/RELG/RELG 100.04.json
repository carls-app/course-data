	"summary": "In the United States, law has a unique burden in regards to religion, insuring that government neither interferes in the religious expression of its populace nor favors one religious tradition over another. Yet, given that law and religion often stake out the same territory--from how we raise our children to how we run our businesses--such an agenda is never as easy as it might seem. In many parts of the Islamic world, on the other hand, activist movements are seeking to transform shari'a (God's will) into state law. \u00a0Here too, ideals are troubled by realities, as complex religious systems are shoehorned into rigid legal frameworks. \u00a0This course will explore the intersections of religion and law in these two distinct contexts, looking at how religion and law come to shape one another and why their intersection is often at the center of key contemporary conflicts, both domestic and international.",
