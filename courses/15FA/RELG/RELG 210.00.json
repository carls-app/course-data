	"summary": "In this course we examine the religious and philosophical roots of prophecy as a form of social criticism in American intellectual and religious history. We pay particular attention to a mode of public exhortation central to African American social criticism that emphasizes spiritual renewal called the Afro-American Jeremiad. Interrogating this tradition, along with differing conceptions of social criticism, we raise numerous questions, such as: Is the Jeremiad tradition still a viable mode of prophetic exhortation? And, with much of contemporary (Black) Christianity's allegiance to capitalism, can the Jeremiad continue to play a prophetic socio-critical role today? This course counts as an African/African American interdisciplinary course.",
