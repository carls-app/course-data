	"summary": "How have Jewish and Palestinian citizens of Israel shaped their senses of personal and collective identity since the early twentieth century? We will explore mental pictures of the land, one's self, and others in a selection of Israeli Jewish and Palestinian short stories, novels, and films. Select fiction and memoirs from Britain's mandate rule in Palestine (1918-1948) will add historical context. Through similar writing we will explore some of the humanistic roots of U.S. involvement in Israeli-Palestinian relations today. Students will research and enrich our class focus by introducing us to perspectives on Israel/Palestine in their home countries or elsewhere.",
