	"summary": "In this course, students learn about Byzantine Greek through initial work on prose selections from different authors, genres, and periods, followed by sustained engagement with a single author. For 2015, we will focus on a historian of the last years of Byzantium who writes a history of a failed Ottoman siege of Constantinople in 1422. Students will also gain some experience with later Greek paleography through readings and hands on work with photographs and facsimiles.",
