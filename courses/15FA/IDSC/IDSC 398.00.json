All members of each interdepartmental comps team must be enrolled at the same time. Students will work with their team toward a customized final project that is closely integrated with their departmentally based comps. Normally students will enroll each term during the senior year, for a total of 3 credits. (For more information on Interconnected Comps, see the GEI website, at https://apps.carleton.edu/collab/gei/.)",
