Our group will attend six to eight performances of German language plays, ranging from the Enlightenment to the post-war period. In preparation for each outing, students will read and discuss the original play, and study its historical and literary context. In the course of the term, we will hone our skills as theater spectators and learn how to describe and critique different performance styles and directorial choices.",
