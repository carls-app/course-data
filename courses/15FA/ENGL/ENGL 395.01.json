	"summary": "For more than a century, assessments of Freudian psychoanalysis and the value of psychoanalytic approaches to literature have risen and fallen, zigged as well as zagged. We will interrogate this situation for ourselves, examining Freud's major theories, the checkered history of their application to literary study, the privileged position Freud granted to literature in his work, the roles of narrative and interpretation in his case histories and conception of \"the talking cure.\" Reading Freud and his followers alongside works of twentieth-century literature, criticism, and critical theory, we will debate whether (or to what extent) psychoanalytic approaches put an end to fruitful inquiries or inspire and enable them.",
