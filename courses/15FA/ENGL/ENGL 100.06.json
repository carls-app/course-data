	"summary": "How do we, how should we, respond to the autobiographical writings of public figures, private citizens, academics, or movie stars? Are there common strategies employed in these acts and processes of self-mapping? Does accuracy matter to us if we happen to find these textual self-portraits appealing? We will keep questions like these in mind as we read, discuss, and write about autobiographies and memoirs by Maya Angelou, Sidney Poitier, James McBride, Barack Obama, bell hooks, and John Hope Franklin.",
