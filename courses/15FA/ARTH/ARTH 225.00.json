	"summary": "This course examines Gothic art and architecture, both religious and secular, during the late Middle Ages and then again, with the Gothic Revival, after the Industrial Revolution. The course investigates how the concept of the Gothic evolved, explores how the Gothic style became invested with various cultural connotations, and traces its various deployments in popular culture. In the medieval period, this course focuses on works of art from France, England, Germany and Italy from the twelfth through fourteenth centuries. Discussions of the Gothic Revival from the nineteenth century onward focus more broadly upon Europe and the United States. Approximately half of the class sessions will be held at St. Olaf.",
