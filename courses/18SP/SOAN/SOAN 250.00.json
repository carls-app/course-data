We will examine the historical and structural processes that have shaped contact among indigenous, European, and African peoples in Latin America during Conquest and the colonial period, under conditions of global economic expansion and state formation, and in present day urban centers and extractive \"frontiers.\" Special attention will be given to local-level transformations and resistance as well as issues of migration and gender construction.",
