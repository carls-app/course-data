	"summary": "This class will begin by exploring the representation of India in the colonial British imagination and segue into the representation of Britain by contemporary South Asian immigrant writers. We will examine the ways in which British and Indian identities are staged, contested and constructed in both the colonial and postcolonial period. Primary texts will include novels by Kipling, Forster, Kureishi and Kunzru; we will also read a range of postcolonial theory and watch related films and television shows.",
