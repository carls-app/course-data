	"summary": "This Argument and Inquiry seminar will focus on how individuals and groups of people make important decisions, both personal and professional, and how teams of people make policy decisions. We'll look at reasoning and decision-making from a variety of frameworks, including those of formal logic, cognitive psychology, social psychology, scientific hypothesis testing, business management. Case studies of major political, economic, or technology policy decisions will be examined and discussed. Students will also analyze and reflect on their own academic and career decisions, learning to describe and explore different decision-making styles and approaches.",
