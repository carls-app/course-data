	"summary": "This course investigates how the social, technological, and natural worlds are connected, and how the study of networks sheds light on these connections. A network is a collection of entities linked by some relationship: people connected by friendships (e.g., Facebook); web pages connected by hyperlinks; species connected by the who-preys-on-whom relationship. We will explore mathematical properties of networks while emphasizing the efficient processing and analysis of network data drawn from a variety of fields. Topics include: how Google works; \"six degrees of separation\"; the spread of fads through society. No background in computer science or programming is required or expected.",
