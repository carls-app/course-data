	"summary": "The Internet is composed of a large number of heterogeneous, independently-operating computer networks that work together to transport all sorts of data to points all over the world. The fact that it does this so well given its complexity is a minor miracle. In this class, we'll study the structure of these individual networks and of the Internet, and figure out how this \"magic\" takes place. Topics include TCP/IP, protocols and their implementations, routing, security, network architecture, DNS, peer-to-peer networking, and Wi-Fi along with ethical and privacy issues.",
