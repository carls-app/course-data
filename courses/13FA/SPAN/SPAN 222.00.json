	"summary": "Considered one of the greatest writers of the twentieth century, Gabriel García Márquez defines magical realism. His works record the reality of his native Colombia, embedding it within the mythic patterns of Latin American cultures and histories. Like García Márquez, Laura Restrepo began her writing career as a journalist, but her lens remains firmly anchored in the reality of Colombia's encounters with political violence and drug cartels. In what she calls \"report style,\" Restrepo, too, tells the story of Colombia. The course focuses on selected works by these two authors, a study of contexts, themes, and styles. In translation.",
