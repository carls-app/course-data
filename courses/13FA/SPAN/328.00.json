	"summary": "In this course we will be studying the various meanings of what has been labeled, esthetically and sociologically, as the Post-Modernist age, or Late Modernity. We will also study the relationship between \"postmodernism\" and what has been called the \"culture of contentment\" or \"culture of well-being,\" and we will attempt to understand the interactions that exist between culture, market and dominant ideology. To develop this theme we will focus on Spain, but will also continually establish relationships with other countries. This course includes many cultural products (novels, films, documentaries, animated essays, visual poetry, gag cartoons, graphic novel, comics, etc.). Evening films, guest lectures.",
