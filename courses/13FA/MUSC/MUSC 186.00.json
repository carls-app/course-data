Membership is offered to students who demonstrate exceptional vocal and musical skills. The need to balance all parts (Soprano, Alto, Tenor and Bass) dictates the size of the ensemble. With few exceptions, membership is for the full year. Admission by audition and concurrent registration in Music 185 are required.",
