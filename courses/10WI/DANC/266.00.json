	"summary": "Dance is an art of the body in time and space and culture. This course will look at dance as a symbolic system of meanings based on bodily display. The investigation of the body as a \"text\" will be anchored by, but not limited to, feminist perspectives. Through reading, writing, discussing, moving, viewing videos and performances the class will \"read\" the gender, race, and politics of the dancing body in a historical context from Romanticism through Post-modernism.",
