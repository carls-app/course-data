Each term, the ensemble presents a concert of short and extended works from the large bodies of classical, ethnic and cultural repertories, including works for mixed, treble and tenor-bass voices. Concerts are sometimes repeated off campus. Students must have good vocal skills, music reading ability, and a high degree of interest in performing quality choral music. Admission is by audition.",
