	"summary": "Why do some observations of consumer behavior contradict the predictions of economic theory? By combining psychological and economic models of behavior, behavioral economists develop alternatives to standard economic theory to explain observed behavioral anomalies. This course will examine questions such as whether addictions can be considered rational, why people hold losing stocks longer than theory predicts, why most dieters are unsuccessful and why people don't save enough money for retirement. Topics covered may include expected utility theory, bounded rationality, prospect theory, hyperbolic discounting and rational addiction.",
