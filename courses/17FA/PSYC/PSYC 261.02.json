Students will engage in a term-long self-directed project aimed at increasing the frequency of a healthy behavior (such as exercising) or decreasing the frequency of an unhealthy behavior (such as smoking). Additionally, we will read and discuss case studies that relate to the current topic in the lecture portion of the course. Concurrent registration in Psychology 260 is required. A grade of C- or better must be earned in both Psychology 260 and 261 to satisfy the LS requirement.",
