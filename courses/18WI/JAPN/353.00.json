	"summary": "This course explores various environmental issues, pollution, recycle, etc., in Japanese using newspaper clips, internet, and other authentic written texts. We will examine what kind of environmental issues Japan faces and how the government and communities are dealing with them. Then students are expected to explore how their communities are dealing with environmental issues. The purpose of the course is to encourage students to think about issues, contents, in Japanese rather than study purely language, grammar and vocabularies. Students are expected to write a short research paper in Japanese and do class presentation at the end.",
