	"summary": "In his great post-World War I poem, T. S. Eliot described the waste land of western civilization as \"a heap of broken images.\" We will explore how the writers of the first half of the twentieth-century invented ways of reshaping those broken images into a new literary art that has come to be called Modernism. Writers studied will likely include Yeats, Joyce, Woolf, and Faulkner. Attention will be given to the writing of literary critical papers, and to supplying students with the foundational tools for more advanced literary study.",
