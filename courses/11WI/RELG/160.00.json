	"summary": "The Hebrew Bible (aka Old Testament) represents a millennium of beliefs, desires, and customs from ancient Israel and Judah, many of which still reverberate today. Who were its authors? Why did they write what they did? How does their writing compare with literatures from the superpowers of their day: the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Egyptians, and the Mesopotamians? Integrating a cross-disciplinary spectrum of religion, history, and literature, students in this class will interpret Hebrew Bible texts in English using methods employed by biblical scholars, asking questions about language and meaning, literary effects, and Hebrew Bible's social and historical contexts.",
