	"summary": "This course will examine the burgeoning field of \"religion and law\" through asking two questions central to its inquiry: 1) How does religion become law? 2) How does secular law extend into domains to which religion also stakes claims through the adjudication process? To answer the first question, we'll examine the development of Islamic shari√° from \"God's Path\" into \"religious law\" in its codification and canonization by the modern state. To answer the second question, we'll look at American First Amendment jurisprudence, examining recent cases to determine how the law defines \"religion\" and what assumptions about religion such definitions legislate.",
