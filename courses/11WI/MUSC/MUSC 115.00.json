	"summary": "This course explores the history and development of film music along with theories of how music contributes to the meaning of moving images and narrative scenes. The primary focus of the course will be on film music in the U.S., but notable film scores from Europe and Asia will also be discussed. The film music history covers historical periods from the pre-cinematic Vaudeville era through the postmodern films of the early twenty-first century. Cross-cutting this chronological history will be discussion of film musicals as a separate genre. Ability to read music not required.",
