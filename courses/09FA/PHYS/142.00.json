	"summary": "An introduction to Newtonian mechanics using calculus. The kinematics and dynamics of objects in motion are investigated using Newton's laws and related conservation laws. Examples of systems studied include table-top objects, simple astronomical systems, or objects in harmonic motion. This section emphasizes a bottom-up atomic perspective and introduces a computational approach to allow the consideration of atoms and molecules inside solids as well. Weekly laboratory or computational work.",
