	"summary": "What is a nation? What is progress and how can we measure it? What is the nature of a just society? How can a country built out of a colonial empire create egalitarian, participatory nations, and is that a desirable goal? What are some of the problems that arise in new nations around land, economy, political participation, and culture? In this course, we seek to answer these questions by exploring the history of Modern Latin America. Through lectures, readings, music and art, we will examine moments when peoples and governments have sought to make and change the modern world.",
