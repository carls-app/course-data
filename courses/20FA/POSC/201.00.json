	"summary": "In this section of three related five-week courses covering the Tools of National Power, students will study how nations use military power to achieve national security and foreign policy objectives. Military power is often used in ways that are fundamentally different from combat operations, and yet are still highly effective. Students will learn the theoretical ways in which nations use military power as part of their statecraft, then look at case studies to assess the application of military power in the real world. Course readings, short papers, and significant classroom discussion will deliver content to students and set the stage for the follow-on courses in diplomatic and economic tools of national power.",
