	"summary": "As the twentieth century's first major social revolution, the Mexican Revolution represents a watershed moment in Latin American history. This course examines the origins of the conflict and its key domestic and international dimensions. It also explores how a collective memory of the Revolution was crafted and contested by the post-revolutionary state, artists, intellectuals, and peasants through the means of photography, murals, education, popular protest, commemorations, and shrines. Emphasis will be placed on agrarian leader and rebel chieftain Emiliano Zapata as both historical figure and myth.",
