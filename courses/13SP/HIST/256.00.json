	"summary": "Who initiated the circulation of new ideas and novel communicative behaviors in urban China? Is there anything Chinese about the \"public\" forged in Chinese cities? This course adopts a comparative and integrative approach to examine the studies of major ritual centers (e.g., Beijing), market towns, and foreign concessions (e.g., Shanghai). Thematically, students will analyze the ongoing tension between time and place as expressed in the conflict between China's colonial past and its search for national identity.",
