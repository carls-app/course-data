	"summary": "Understanding the principles of lasers in conjunction with the framework provided by spectroscopy provides a powerful way to advance a deeper understanding of the molecular basis of chemical reactivity. Important experimental techniques such as Raman scattering methods and molecular beams are explored in addition to a wide range of specific laser applications. Readings are taken from both texts and literature.",
