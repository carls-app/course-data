	"summary": "This course focuses on a selection of high-profile French and English churches built in the Gothic period: the Sainte-Chapelle, Reims Cathedral, and Westminster Abbey. Each commission brought together the finest artists working in a variety of media. We will examine architectural developments of the period, and related arts such as stained glass, sculpture, tombs, shrines, and illuminated manuscripts. More broadly, these works provide a lens through which to consider social, religious, and political issues, especially the cult of saints, the Crusades, and the growing powers of the French and English monarchies.",
