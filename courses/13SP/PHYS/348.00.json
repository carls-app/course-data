	"summary": "Building from the marriage of special relativity and quantum mechanics, the course will examine the structure of relativistic quantum field theory. Possible topics may include the Dirac field, Feynman diagrams and perturbation theory in quantum electrodynamics, renormalization, and select applications in particle physics and condensed-matter physics. The course may also consider current challenges in the field such as that presented by gravity.",
