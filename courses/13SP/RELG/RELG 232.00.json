	"summary": "This course explores the messy entanglements of desire for God and desire for earthly things, erotic relationships with the divine and those among human beings. We begin with Plato's conception of Eros, and then trace its disavowal and/or appropriation in the history of Christian thought and its reemergence in modern and postmodern Western thought, especially that informed by psychoanalysis. We explore the ways that the Christian ascetic and mystical traditions and psychoanalysis are allied discourses inasmuch as they are means of discerning and relating to the desires of the heart.",
