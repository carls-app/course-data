	"summary": "Systems for growing, processing and distributing food have been subject to claims that they are unjust, yet problems persist. This course will examine concepts of justice and apply them to issues related to farmworkers, factory works and others who produce our food, poverty and access to food, and genetically modified organisms as they relate to control of production. We will ask how justice relates to sustainability. Although the course will focus on the United States, global issues such as immigration and food sovereignty will be included. Students will have the opportunity to explore food justice issues in other countries.",
