	"summary": "This class will examine recent political, economic and social transformations that have occurred in the so-called Celtic Fringe: Scotland, Ireland, Cornwall, Wales and Galicia. We will use these regions, which have long occupied marginal positions within much larger and more powerful states, as cases to explore a variety of issues, including center-periphery relations, migration, internal colonialism, autonomous and separatist movements, and regionalism in the context of the European Union.",
