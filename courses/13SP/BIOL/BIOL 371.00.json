	"summary": "Human dominated ecosystems occur wherever human activities become the prevailing force in ecological patterns and processes, including everything from a clear-cut tropical forest to your backyard. It also includes remote areas changing because of human alteration of nutrient cycles and the climate. As human population and impacts grow, so does the need to understand how ecosystems respond. This course will use recent scientific literature to explore this new field of ecology, the study of human dominated ecosystems. Topics include the ecology of cities, decimated ecosystems, ecology of the post-war landscape, preservation and restoration under a changing climate, and designed ecosystem.",
