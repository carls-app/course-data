	"summary": "As moderns, we often think of Nature as an ancient concept. But how old is our idea of the Natural exactly, and what did people think about the environment before the advent of environmentalism, Romanticism, and Christianity as prevailing modes of Western thought? This course will explore how Greeks and Romans conceived of and engaged with their natural environment(s), with special attention to the ways in which ancient ideas differ from modern ones. Using textual and material sources, we will examine ancient attitudes towards nature and the environment through literature, philosophy, religion, politics, science, etc.",
