	"summary": "In this course we study the relationship between myth and history in Central America since its origins in the Popol Vuh, the sacred texts of the Mayans until the period of the post-civil wars era. The course is organized in a chronological manner. We will study, in addition to the Popol Vuh, the chronicles of Alvarado, some poems by Rub\u00e9n Dar\u00edo and Francisco Gavidia, some of the writings of Miguel \u00c3ngel Asturias and Salarru\u00e9. The course will end with a study of critical visions of the mythical presented by more contemporary authors such as Roque Dalton and Luis de Li\u00f3n.",
