	"summary": "A literary investigation of children's literature with close attention to the particular aesthetic issues that follow from the genre's mixing of delight and didacticism, whimsy and pedagogy. We will trace the nineteenth and twentieth-century rise of works written for a child audience back to origins in the power struggles and wish fulfillment of oral tradition tales, the Enlightenment \"fairytale,\" and the Romantic-era \"invention of childhood.\" Works by the Grimms, Straparola, Basile, Perrault, d'Aulnoy, Bettelheim, Wordsworth, Burnett, Kipling, E.B. White, and Sendak.",
